# American British Translator

An app capable of translating American English to British English and vice versa. Select the desired style of English to translate. Node and Express are used to create a RESTful API. The back-end handles client side HTTP requests for sentence translations. If any word in the sentence is translatable, an algorithm will inject and highlight the replacement. The Chai and Mocha testing tools are used for unit and function testing.
